Rigid String Zendo
========================================================================

An inductive logic game inspired by [Zendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendo_%28game%29). The computer generates a rule which accepts or rejects strings. You ask the computer whether various strings are accepted or rejected. Once you think you've deduced the rule, the computer will test you.

----------

Ensure that you've [installed Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and that you've [installed Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), then run fuzzy_zendo.py.
